# **Yahoo Sports NFL Injury Report Web Scraper**

## **Purpose of Project**
This project loads the most current NFL injuries from the Yahoo Sports website. The data is then populated into a CSV file that can be utilized for other projects.

## **Usage**
The nfl-yahoo.py file is currently designed to scrape for NFL knee-related injuries. However, the Yahoo Sports data can be filtered for certain injuries by altering the Keywords list at the top of the nfl-yahoo.py file. The name of the CSV file can be altered in line 85 of the nfl-yahoo.py file. The code is programmed to scrape for injuries in the last 5 NFL seasons (if applicable).
